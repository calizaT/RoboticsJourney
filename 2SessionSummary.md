# Session Summary: Desgin and Prototype
## Objectives of Mentoring Session
- Understand the importance of conceptual design in robotics
- create a preliminary sketcg if tge ribit
- identify necessary components for the robot, based on the defined requirements
- introduce the concept of repid prototyping and its tools

## Key Points to Cover
1. **Brainstorm Design Principless**
2. **Sketching the Robot**
3. **Component Identification**: Identify and discuss essential components needed for the robot, including sensors, motors and microcontrollers.
4. **Introduce Prototyping**: explain the concept of rapid prototyping and how to implement it with tools as Arduino, RaspberrzPy. MVP concept.


## Activities
